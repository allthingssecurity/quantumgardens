    "title": "Superposition",
    "body": "A quantum system can occupy multiple states at the same time, described by a superposition of amplitudes.
When you do not look, the system evolves as a combination of all possibilities.
Only when measured does one outcome get selected, with probabilities set by the amplitudes.
This is the starting point for qubits, interference and quantum parallelism."
  },
  {
    "title": "Wave-Particle Duality",
    "body": "Light and matter behave as both waves and particles, depending on how you probe them.
In the double-slit experiment, single electrons produce an interference pattern over time—pure wave behavior.
Yet each detection event is a localized particle-like click.
The dual description is captured by quantum states and probability amplitudes."
  },
  {
    "title": "Entanglement",
    "body": "Entangled particles share a joint state that cannot be written as separate parts.
Measurements on one are correlated with the other beyond classical limits (Bell violations).
Entanglement is a resource for teleportation, superdense coding and quantum advantage.
Creating, distributing and preserving entanglement are central engineering challenges."
  },
  {
    "title": "Measurement",
    "body": "Measurement converts quantum possibilities into a single, recorded outcome.
It disturbs the system, projecting the state onto the measured basis.
Probabilities come from the squared amplitudes (Born rule).
Choice of measurement matters: different bases reveal different aspects of the same state."
  },
  {
    "title": "Interference",
    "body": "Quantum amplitudes add and cancel like waves, creating bright and dark fringes in outcomes.
Paths that are in phase reinforce each other; those out of phase suppress each other.
Which-path information destroys interference, linking knowledge and visibility of fringes.
Interference underlies speedups in quantum algorithms and precision in sensors."
  },
  {
    "title": "Decoherence",
    "body": "Interaction with the environment leaks which-state information and suppresses superpositions.
Coherent phase relations decay over a characteristic time (T2), turning quantum behavior classical.
Good hardware isolates qubits and uses dynamical decoupling to fight decoherence.
Error correction combats residual noise by encoding one logical qubit into many physical qubits."
  },
  {
    "title": "Qubits",
    "body": "A qubit is a two-level quantum system—any superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩.
Its state lives on the Bloch sphere; rotations implement single-qubit gates.
Physical qubits come in many forms: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photons, spins.
Measurement reads out in a chosen basis, collapsing the state to 0 or 1."
  },
  {
    "title": "Uncertainty Principle",
    "body": "Certain pairs of observables (like position and momentum) cannot both be sharp at once.
The product of their uncertainties is bounded—knowledge of one limits knowledge of the other.
This is not a flaw of instruments but a feature of quantum states.
Fourier relationships and non-commuting operators encode the trade‑off mathematically."
  },
  {
    "title": "Quantum Tunneling",
    "body": "Particles can cross energy barriers even when they do not have enough classical energy.
The wavefunction has a small tail through the barrier that becomes transmission probability.
Tunnel diodes, Josephson junctions and nuclear fusion rely on tunneling.
In biology, tunneling can influence enzyme reactions and olfaction hypotheses."
